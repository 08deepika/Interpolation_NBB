# Interpolation_NBB
# Image Resizing and Interpolation Techniques

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates different image resizing techniques and interpolation methods using Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL. The notebook covers:

- Downloading and loading images from URLs and local files.
- Image resizing using:
  - Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
  - Bilinear Interpolation
  - Bicubic Interpolation
  
- Comparing the quality of resized images using metrics like:
  - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
  - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
- Visualizing results with Matplotlib.
  
The notebook is designed as a practical guide to understanding how resizing algorithms affect image quality, and how metrics can be used to quantitatively assess interpolation methods.
